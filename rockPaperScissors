start by creating a scanner and a random
then ask for a username and scan
generate all the variables we need to use
then add some fun things for the username input
start a while loop to loop everything while var1 is true
generate a random number 1-3
ask and scan the input of a person
then change the user input to a number 1-3
then start to compare the user input to computer based on number value
print who won or lost and ask if they want to play again
if they say yes go through the while loop and repeat
if they say no then turn the var1 to false ending the loop
then divide games played by games won to get win WinPercentage and print
